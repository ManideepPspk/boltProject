# Getting Started with Create Vehicle React App by Manideep.

After cloning the code, run `npm intall` to install the dependencies.

# To access the json data please follow one of the following:-

1. Add `Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin` extension in your browser and enable it to make calls to the json. ( most preferable as you can see the calls in network tab)
 or
2. If you want to use local json data without making calls please uncomment the 3,7 lines and comment line 6 in `src/services/VehicleService.js`.


# To run the application , run the command `npm start`.

The website is hosted online using `Netlify`.

# Please add `Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin` extension in your browser and turn it on after adding the extension as the api has CORS issue or do download the code and change the service file to local json.
